# 42_Net_Practice
This is one of the 42tokyo's projects. This project is different from others, I just learned TCP/IP networking. Thus this repository is not including some program, and there are just log of my learning about TCP/IP.

# What I learned in this project
- What is IP address
- What is subnet mask
- IP address calculation
- IP address overlap
- routing table
